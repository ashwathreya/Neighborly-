## What is Neighborly?

Neighborly is a comprehensive, one-stop marketplace platform that revolutionizes how people discover and connect with local service providers. Instead of visiting multiple platforms like Care.com, Rover, Thumbtack, and TaskRabbit separately, Neighborly aggregates service providers from 35+ platforms into a single, unified interface.

### The Vision

To create a seamless, user-friendly platform where users can search, compare, and book services across multiple categories—all in one place. Neighborly eliminates the frustration of juggling multiple websites and accounts, providing a centralized hub for all service needs.
